## Java For Launchers

These are some code examples I found while cleaning out my office.

Java is a compiled language, which means you have to compile it. :p

For example, to run the HelloWorld program ( when in that directory ):

    javac HelloWorld.java
    java HelloWorld

The first line compiles the code into a java class file, and the second uses
java to run the code.

Feel free to contact me about anthing.
