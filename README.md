## Java Class

These are some code examples I found while cleaning out my office.
Most of the code is copied verbatum from my teacher, Arland J Richmond.

Java is a compiled language, which means you have to compile it. :p

For example, to run the HelloWorld program ( when in that directory ):

    javac HelloWorld.java
    java HelloWorld

The first line compiles the code into a java class file, and the second uses
java to run the code.

I assume that you can get JDK running up on your own...

Feel free to fork and send a pull request.  I'm sure the code could use some refactoring.
