## Readme for the binary tree

Compiling this code:

    javac Tree.java

Will result in 3 files being created with extension '.class'.

To run the program, type:

    java TreeApp

The Node has a key and a value.  While running the application, the key is what
the tree is sorted with, and is what you see if you use the 'show' option.

This is a confusing one, you'll have to play around with the menu to see what
the menu options actually do...
